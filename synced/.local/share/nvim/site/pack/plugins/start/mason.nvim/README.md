## Introduction

> [`:h mason-introduction`][help-mason-introduction]

`mason.nvim` is a Neovim plugin that allows you to easily manage external editor tooling such as LSP servers, DAP servers,
linters, and formatters through a single interface. It runs everywhere Neovim runs (across Linux, macOS, Windows, etc.),
with only a small set of [external requirements](#requirements) needed.

Packages are installed in Neovim's data directory ([`:h standard-path`][help-standard-path]) by default. Executables are
linked to a single `bin/` directory, which `mason.nvim` will add to Neovim's PATH during setup, allowing seamless access
from Neovim builtins (LSP client, shell, terminal, etc.) as well as other 3rd party plugins.

For a list of all available packages, see <https://mason-registry.dev/registry/list>.

## Installation & Usage

> [`:h mason-quickstart`][help-mason-quickstart]

Install using your plugin manager of choice. **Setup is required**:

```lua
require("mason").setup()
```

`mason.nvim` is optimized to load as little as possible during setup. Lazy-loading the plugin, or somehow deferring the
setup, is not recommended.

Refer to the [Configuration](#configuration) section for information about which settings are available.

### Recommended setup for `lazy.nvim`

The following is the recommended setup when using `lazy.nvim`. It will set up the plugin for you, meaning **you don't have
to call `require("mason").setup()` yourself**.

```lua
{
    "mason-org/mason.nvim",
    opts = {}
}
```

## Requirements

> [`:h mason-requirements`][help-mason-requirements]

`mason.nvim` relaxes the minimum requirements by attempting multiple different utilities (for example, `wget`,
`curl`, and `Invoke-WebRequest` are all perfect substitutes).
The _minimum_ recommended requirements are:

-   neovim `>= 0.10.0`
-   For Unix systems:
    -   `git(1)`
    -   `curl(1)` or `GNU wget(1)`
    -   `unzip(1)`
    -   GNU tar (`tar(1)` or `gtar(1)` depending on platform)
    -   `gzip(1)`
-   For Windows systems:
    -   pwsh or powershell
    -   git
    -   GNU tar
    -   One of the following:
        -   [7zip][7zip]
        -   [peazip][peazip]
        -   [archiver][archiver]
        -   [winzip][winzip]
        -   [WinRAR][winrar]

Note that `mason.nvim` will regularly shell out to external package managers, such as `cargo` and `npm`. Depending on
your personal usage, some of these will also need to be installed. Refer to `:checkhealth mason` for a full list.

## Commands

> [`:h mason-commands`][help-mason-commands]

-   `:Mason` - opens a graphical status window
-   `:MasonUpdate` - updates all managed registries
-   `:MasonInstall <package> ...` - installs/re-installs the provided packages
-   `:MasonUninstall <package> ...` - uninstalls the provided packages
-   `:MasonUninstallAll` - uninstalls all packages
-   `:MasonLog` - opens the `mason.nvim` log file in a new tab window

## Registries

Mason's core package registry is located at [mason-org/mason-registry](https://github.com/mason-org/mason-registry).
Before any packages can be used, the registry needs to be downloaded. This is done automatically for you when using the
different Mason commands (e.g. `:MasonInstall`), but can also be done manually by using the `:MasonUpdate` command.

If you're utilizing Mason's Lua APIs to access packages, it's recommended to use the
[`:h mason-registry.refresh()`][help-mason-registry-refresh] or [`:h mason-registry.update()`][help-mason-registry-update]
functions to ensure you have the latest package information before retrieving packages.

## Configuration

> [`:h mason-settings`][help-mason-settings]

You may optionally configure certain behavior of `mason.nvim` when calling the `.setup()` function. Refer to the
[default configuration](#default-configuration) for a list of all available settings.

Example:

```lua
require("mason").setup({
    ui = {
        icons = {
            package_installed = "✓",
            package_pending = "➜",
            package_uninstalled = "✗"
        }
    }
})
```

### Configuration using `lazy.nvim`

```lua
{
    "mason-org/mason.nvim",
    opts = {
        ui = {
            icons = {
                package_installed = "✓",
                package_pending = "➜",
                package_uninstalled = "✗"
            }
        }
    }
}
```
